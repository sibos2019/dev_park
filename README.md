# dev_park Programme

## Welcome!

Welcome and thank you for your interests in participating the first ever hackathon at Sibos! We are expecting around 20 to 30 developers and we are looking forward to have you in London with us to hack out real problems that's been bugging our community. We cannot wait to see your solutions which will be presented to over 10,000 attendeees at Sibos. 

This hackathon may be different and unique in that it's not about promoting service from a particular company, instead it's about cross industry collaboration and solving problems that matter. We cultivated a problem statement pool which will be preseted in the pre-Sibos kick off call on Sep 5th. If you agree with us in achieving this goal, you are at the right place! Let's do something really awesome for the betterment of the entire community.

## Hacking

We provide the open, collaborative software developement enviornemnt including infrastructure, communication and support to help you hack. You are enabled with AWS cloud to deploy your apps, github to collaborate & publish your source code and Slack for support prior and during the hackathon. In case you are wondering, we ask you to open source your solution! Again, we are here to solve problems that would be beneficial to our community. What we are asking of you is that you bring your own devices, pick a challenge that you believe in and hack away!
